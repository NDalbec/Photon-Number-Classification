Introduction
============

Single photon event classification for transition edge sensor signals.
The entire process is an unsupervised process based on dimensionality reduction 
using an autoencoder and labeling using gaussian mixture and kernel density estimation.

The :ref:`AutoencoderAPI` offers a high-level API based on widely used libraries such as
`Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#>`_ 
and `Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_. 
The API allows the user to create different autoencoder architectures and train them.
The trained networks can be stored and initialized for direct implementation 
to signal analysis scripts.
